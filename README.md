# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This project uses machine learning to predict Titanic passengers' survival using feature engineering, data preprocessing, model selection, and bagging. A Voting Classifier and Bagging Classifier combine the predictive power of multiple models for better accuracy and robustness. Suggestions for potential future improvements are also included.
