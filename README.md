# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This project uses machine learning to predict Titanic passengers' survival using feature engineering, data preprocessing, model selection, and bagging. A Voting Classifier and Bagging Classifier combine the predictive power of multiple models for better accuracy and robustness. Suggestions for potential future improvements are also included.

In this project, machine learning techniques are used to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The data for the project is derived from the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and cabin details.

Various data science methods are implemented, starting with Feature Engineering to select and transform the relevant variables from raw data. This is followed by Data Preprocessing where missing data fields are filled in and the categorical data is converted into numerical data.

After processing the data, the next step involves Data Visualization where scatter plots, histograms, and density plots are used to visualize the relationship between different variables.

The heart of this project is the use of Machine Learning algorithms to develop predictive models. Three models, including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multiple Layers Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Trees, are implemented. A process called Bagging is used to improve the stability and accuracy of these machine learning algorithms.

Finally, a Voting Classifier method is used to make the final predictions. This method combines predictions from individual models to obtain a more accurate and robust prediction.

This project effectively demonstrates how different data science technologies can come together to predict outcomes in a binary classification problem.
